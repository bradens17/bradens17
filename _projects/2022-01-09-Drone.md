Modelled personal drone design in SolidWorks. I wanted to do a project to refine my CAD skills especially using advanced surfacing techinques. In addition, I am fascinated my drones and it was a fun project to design my own. I designed the enclosure to be injection molded therefore used draft angles and DFM techinques.
