Developed a testing fixture to leak test all units from production in pressure and vacuum. Objective of project was to improve test-time and accuracy. Gained experience creating detailed CAD models and drawings in SolidWorks for machining. Resulted in improving efficiency from previous tester by 400% with a 4-chamber concurrent testing design and removed potential for false results by eliminating technique dependencies.
