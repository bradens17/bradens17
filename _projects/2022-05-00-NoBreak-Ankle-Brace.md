# The Challenge
On a team of Engineering Students and Commerce Students we are starting a venture to design a novel type of ankle brace. We identified a gap that indivuals are not willing to wear ankle braces untill after an injury occurs as they are too unfortable and can affect performance. We are desigining an ankle brace that can provide the same potection as a rigid ankle brace at high injury risk moments but be completely flexible at low risk moments.

# What I learned
More comming soon.
