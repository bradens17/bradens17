# The Challenge
In my 4 month internship at Tesla, this was my big project that took up the majority of my time there. I was tasked to design and build a fixture to test a new manufacturing process- laser welding the inner and outter body sides together. 

# What I learned
### Deisgn
I used Catia v6 (3dExperience) to model and design the fixture. Depsite not learned GD&T explicity in my studies and had to implement lots of GD&T principles into the design of this fixture. As identifying datums and ensuring the parts are perfectly contrained throughout the process was extremely important. I used NAAMS blocks as that was a standard practice on my team and in vehicle manufacuring therefore I had easy access to them.  

### Build
During this time our team's technicians were extremely busy therefore I was only given 1 tech to help me with the build and I had take on a big portion of the build myself (under a tight time constraint of course). I learned how to program and run a CNC Machine to fabricate many of the parts as shown in middle image below. I was able to put together 3 scrap large steel baseplates with rather than ordering a new one. After the design in CAD was finalized I waterjet cut all the holes for parts onto the baseplates for highly accuarate placements.

### Certification
After the build was complete, I worked with dimensional engineers to certify the fixture. We used a CMM to measure all 55 datums ensuring a tolerance of 0.15mm. This process involved lots of shimming and tweaking of the fixture. I learned that its very important to keep this in mind throughout the design as it is extremely difficult to meet this tolerances and anyway to help make the certification process simpler helps substatially. 

### Shipping
This fixture was being sent across the world to run the test. I learned that logistics of shipping should be planned as early as possible. As on the last few days there was lots of scrambling to find crates and correct pallets as there was some inncorrect information relayed. In the end it was shipped out on my 2nd last day fortunately.
