# The Challenge
In my 4 month internship at Tesla, this was my big project that took up the majority of my time there. I was tasked to design and build a fixture to test a new manufacturing process- laser welding the inner and outter body sides together. 

# What I learned
### Deisgn
I used Catia v6 (3dExperience) to model and design the fixture. Depsite not learned GD&T explicity in my studies and had to implement lots of GD&T principles into the design of this fixture. As identifying datums and ensuring the parts are perfectly contrained throughout the process was extremely important. I used NAAMS blocks as that was a standard practice on my team and in vehicle manufacuring therefore I had easy access to them.  

### Build
During this time our team's technicians were extremely busy therefore I was given 1 tech to help me with the build and I had take on a big portion of the build myself. I learned how to program and run a CNC Machine to cut b many of the parts.
