# The Challenge
In my four-month internship at Tesla, a substantial portion of my time was dedicated to a pivotal project. I was assigned the task of conceptualizing and constructing a fixture to assess a novel manufacturing technique: laser welding the inner and outer body sides together.

# What I learned
### Deisgn
For the design phase, I employed Catia v6 (3dExperience) to model and plan the fixture. Despite not having explicit prior exposure to Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) in my academic studies, I found myself incorporating numerous GD&T principles into the fixture's design. The identification of datums and ensuring precise constraints throughout the process proved to be critically important. Adopting NAAMS blocks, a standard practice on my team and in vehicle manufacturing, facilitated the process due to ready access.


### Build
Given the intense workload of our team's technicians at that time, I was allocated only one technician to assist with the build. Consequently, I took on a substantial portion of the build myself, working under tight time constraints. A significant learning experience involved acquiring proficiency in programming and operating a CNC machine to fabricate various components, as depicted in the middle image below. To optimize resources, I creatively assembled the fixture using three discarded large steel baseplates instead of procuring new ones. Following the CAD design finalization, I executed waterjet cutting on the baseplates, ensuring highly accurate placements for the fixture components.

### Certification
Following the completion of the build, my involvement extended to collaborating with dimensional engineers for the certification of the fixture. Utilizing a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), we meticulously measured all 55 datums, adhering to a stringent tolerance of 0.15mm. This phase required extensive shimming and fine-tuning of the fixture. It underscored the critical importance of considering these precision requirements from the outset of the design process. I gained firsthand insight into the complexity of meeting such tight tolerances and realized that any design considerations aimed at simplifying the certification process significantly contribute to its success.

### Shipping
The fixture was set to be sent worldwide for testing, and I realized the critical need for early logistics planning. In the final days, there was a rush to meet shipping requirements, schedule trucks, and decide on the shipping method. Despite some last-minute hurdles, everything fell into place. An incident occurred where a technician accidentally tipped the forklift while moving the fixture, but despite this, the overall outcome was successful, highlighting the importance of proactive planning and adaptability in handling unforeseen challenges during shipping.
