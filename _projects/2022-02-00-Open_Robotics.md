# What I learned
Conducted research on existing robot arm and joint combinations
Performed preliminary motor specification and link length calculations
Decided to employ a spherical wrist to improve maneuverability of end-effector
Leading the design of the static arm of the robot to provide a rigid support for the payload while dynamic arm is not in use, with emphasis on symmetry, simplicity and aesthetics 
Designing the arm enclosure to house all electronic components without impeding arm movement according to the competition requirements
