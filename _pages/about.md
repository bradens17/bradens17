I am currently one of thirty students specializing in Mechatronics under the Mechanical Engineering
program at UBC. I have 12 months of co-op work experience from as a Product Engineer at IFD Corporation. Additionally, I am a member of the OpenRobotics Design Team at UBC.

In my free time I love to go stay active by hiking or play sports. Growing up I played every sport I could. I even managed to repersent team Canada playing baseball at the Senior League World Series.

I also love to travel. I enjoy learning about different cultures and meeting people from all around the world. I have been to Australlia, New Zealand, Greece, Mexico, Cuba and I am currently planning a trip to Korea. I feel that travelling not only expands my knowledge but helps me learn more about myself.

And finally, I am always ready to jump in and try new things!
